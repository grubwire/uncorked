Apply CW HACKs for dlls/ntdll/unix/signal_x86_64.c to a Gcenx/wine 11.x source tree.

Backports:
  - CW HACK 22131: fake-success NtSetContextThread debug-register sets under
    Rosetta (both 64-bit and 32-bit wow64 paths). Without this the JVM kills
    itself the first time it tries to install a hardware breakpoint.
  - CW HACK 23427: emulate XGETBV (xcr0) for Rosetta, which doesn't expose
    AVX state via the host CPUID path; plus Sequoia-aware AVX-512 bits.
  - CW HACK 24256: cache sysctl proc_translated in signal_init_process so
    the rest of the file can read `is_rosetta2` from a signal-safe variable.

Usage:  patch-cw-signal.py <path-to-wine-src>

Idempotent: a second run detects the marker and exits 0.

Wraps scripts/patches/cw-signal.patch via `git apply`. The .patch file is
a normal unified diff against stock Gcenx/wine 11.9; using `git apply`
keeps the script robust to whitespace nits that marker-anchored string
replacement would trip on.
