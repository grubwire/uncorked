# Session state — redesign loop finished (2026-05-29)

The HIG-aligned visual redesign (Task D) shipped, and this session closed out
three of the four follow-up items. Design source of truth:
`docs/specs/visual-design-direction.md`.

Standing constraint: **native bones, custom skin**. No user-facing strings
mention Wine / engine / wrappers / version numbers (CLAUDE.md naming rule —
overrides spec lines that mention "engine version").

## ✅ SWG launcher crashes FIXED (#84/#93) — in-game pending DXVK (2026-05-29)

The SWG launcher's login crash (#84) and patcher crash (#93) are **fixed**
(`3fad7e6`) — login, content, and the full 8.4 GB game download all work with
zero crashes. **In-game render is not yet confirmed** (the game client launches
but shows a black screen — DXVK blocker; see "In-game attempt" below). So the
crash class is solved; keep #84/#93 open until you can actually play. The root cause was **not** Wine networking, certs, or a Wine-fork
gap we had to patch — it was a **JVM↔Wine thread-suspension bug**: HotSpot
crashes with `Illegal threadstate encountered: 6` (`safepoint.cpp:712`), and
faults in Wine's `ntdll`, when it suspends a thread mid native↔VM transition to
reach a safepoint. It hit hardest on the launcher's **network/Finalizer
threads** closing TLS connections — which is exactly why content/patch-check
appeared to "hang on the network" (connections in `CLOSE_WAIT`) and the patcher
died ~392 MB in. (TLS itself was always fine: 14 successful handshakes, no cert
errors; the cacerts even has ISRG Root X1.)

**Fix:** extend the seeded `_JAVA_OPTIONS` for bundled-JRE launchers to suppress
the avoidable safepoints — `-XX:-UseBiasedLocking`,
`-XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:GuaranteedSafepointInterval=0`,
`-XX:-UsePerfData` (in `JavaAppDetector.recommendedJavaOptions`; also written
into the SWG bottle's per-program plist so it applies now).

**Verified live:** login works → launcher content + news load → "Update"
becomes available → patcher downloads **past 1.8 GB** with zero crashes (it
died at ~392 MB before). How we found it: `javax.net.debug` capture (via a
shell launch with stderr→file, since the JVM does its own TLS, not Wine's
schannel) caught the fatal safepoint error firing on the URL-Loader/Finalizer
threads. Follow-ups: minimize the flag set, verify/close the GitHub issues.

## Shipped (all on `origin/main`)

**Task D — redesign (prior session):** spec amendments `8a67081`; accent
`cf35f24`; native toolbar `08967c3` (+ icon fixes `d6af693`, `3a24689`);
contained library + rows `e937c13`; row redesign + context menu `a86fa7e`;
inline detail + native Settings sidebar + materials `5ee41dd` (+ accent-bar
drop `0ad8662`); single-instance + a11y `fc0768b`; labeled "+ Install"
affordance `7f567c9`; Task-D doc `4006c3f`.

**This session (redesign-loop cleanup):**
- `1c8d18e` — **dead-code removed**: deleted `AppSettingsSheet.swift` +
  `SettingsView.swift` and their pbxproj entries (superseded by
  `EntryDetailView` / `InlineSettingsView`). Build green.
- `c2f67e5` — **Settings content cleanup**: real General (App Data Location
  with Show in Finder + Change…, no raw container path), Updates (second
  toggle relabeled "Windows compatibility updates" — no "engine" string,
  still its own key), About (icon + version + GitHub / Website / Report-an-
  Issue links; dropped the engine-version line). Replaced the thin shim
  group-views with finished content.

Theme tokens: `rowSurface`, `rowSurfaceHover`, `regionBorder`,
`Typography.sectionHeader`. All built clean and runtime-checked.

## Decisions worth remembering
- **Install affordance**: labeled "+ Install" toolbar button (blue primary,
  `.titleAndIcon`), suppressed when the library is empty (hero CTA is the
  single target there). Intentional — don't native-correct to a bare icon.
- **Sidebar selection**: native `.sidebar` blue pill, no custom accent bar.
- **No user-facing engine/version strings** anywhere (Updates toggle, About,
  detail Advanced all comply). NOTE: `DiagnosticsView` still has a
  `Section("Engine")` — diagnostics is developer-facing but worth a sweep.
- **Omitted on purpose**: "Change Icon…" (no backing), DLL-overrides editor
  (none exists), engine version in detail/About. Don't ship empty editors.

## "Launch re-runs the installer" — MISDIAGNOSED, not a Crosswire bug (2026-05-29)

Investigated and **cleared**. Last session I saw a `SWGLegendsSetup.exe`
process and inferred Crosswire's Launch ran the installer. Three independent
lines of evidence show that's wrong — Crosswire resolves/launches the correct
installed launcher every time:
1. Bottle `BD247FEE`'s persisted `primaryProgramURL` is the launcher
   (`…/SWG Legends/SWGLegendsLauncher.exe`), not the installer.
2. All five recent run logs show `start /unix …/SWGLegendsLauncher.exe`.
3. `updateInstalledPrograms` enumerates only `drive_c/Program Files[ (x86)]`
   inside the bottle, so `~/Downloads/SWGLegendsSetup.exe` can't ever be in the
   list `runPrimary` chooses from.

The `SWGLegendsSetup.exe` process was either a stale leftover from a prior
launcher run, or the SWG launcher's own child — the launcher re-invokes its
Downloads bootstrapper because the game is **not fully installed** (SWG dir is
only ~237 MB: launcher + a few patch `.tre` files + `hs_err_pid228.log`, the
#93 crash dump). That's downstream of #93 (patcher crash leaves the install
incomplete), not a primary-resolution bug. **No Crosswire fix needed here.**

## Single-instance — needs its own pass

Shipped (`fc0768b`) but **currently inert** (safe). Verified at runtime:
`Wine.runningProcessIDs` matches `WINEPREFIX=<prefix>` in `ps -E`, but macOS
**hides the environment of Crosswire's detached `wine start /unix` processes**
from `ps` (`ps -E -p <pid>` shows command only). So detection returns empty →
the guard never fires → it always falls through and spawns. The self-healing
design means launches are NOT broken, just un-deduped.

- **Lead fix candidate: match by argv, not env.** The wine process's argv IS
  visible (`Z:\…\X.exe` / `C:\Program Files…\X.exe`) even when env isn't. Map
  the bottle's program URL → its Windows path/basename and match.
- **Weak spot that approach must solve:** basename collisions across bottles
  (two bottles with the same exe name). Needs to disambiguate (e.g. full
  Windows path, or correlate with the launched program), not just basename.
- Confirming winemac.drv GUI apps surface as `NSRunningApplication` with
  `.regular` policy is still unverified (the installer, not a GUI app, was
  what launched during the test — see the bug above).

## Observability state (diagnosed 2026-05-29)

- **Local logging: yes.** Each wine launch writes a timestamped file to
  `~/Library/Logs/app.Crosswire.Crosswire/<ISO8601>.log` (`Wine.makeFileHandle`):
  app + bottle header, process info (args/exe/cwd/env), then every stdout
  (`Logger.wineKit.info`) and stderr (`.warning`) line + the exit status.
  Dual-logged to os.log (Console.app). Logs auto-pruned after 7 days.
- **Crash surfacing:** `FailureWatcher` shows a "stopped unexpectedly" dialog
  (Report… → prefilled GitHub issue with log + engine version + bottle config /
  View Log / Not Now) on `crosswireProgramDidExit` when `isAbnormal`
  (`exitCode != 0`), debounced 30s/exe. **Manual reporter, not telemetry.**
- **⚠️ The gap that matters:** launches use detached `wine start /unix`. The
  captured process is the `start` invocation, which exits ~immediately (status
  0) after handing off to wineserver; at that point `drainPipesAtTermination`
  clears the readers and **closes the log handle**. So the per-run log captures
  only the launch + first seconds — the long-running app's later output
  (crash-time Wine/JVM stderr) is NOT captured, and FailureWatcher never fires
  (start exited 0). **GUI-app crashes (#84/#93 class) are invisible to
  Crosswire's own logs** — the only crash evidence is the JVM's `hs_err_pid*`
  dumps written into the bottle dir.
- **Sentry: not wired** (zero references; no dependency). The Privacy pane's
  "crash reporting in a future release" is pure placeholder text.
- **Notifications: pure placeholder.** The bell is a non-functional button; no
  event model, store, or view behind it.

## Brief 1 — engine diagnostics findings (2026-05-29)

Exercised the `captureDiagnostics` path (built `91998ab` + `c9ffd6f`) against
SWG for the first time. Results:

- **The capture path does NOT work for SWG (or any re-exec'ing launcher).**
  `SWGLegendsLauncher.exe` is a stub that re-execs as a *detached*
  `javaw.exe -jar … (ppid=1)`. The direct-`wine` foreground process exits at
  ~5s when the stub forks javaw, so the per-launch log closed with **only the
  794-byte header — zero app output**, and `presentDiagnostics` fired at that
  5s stub-exit, long before any crash. Same blind spot as `start /unix`, just
  moved to "stub exits". **This is the thing to fix.**
  - Achievable fix: don't end the diagnostics run at foreground-process exit —
    **poll until the bottle is idle** (no wine procs for the prefix), *then*
    scan for + reveal `hs_err_pid*.log`. Delivers the JVM crash dump (the real
    #84/#93 evidence) reliably even without live stdout.
  - Hard part (defer): live stdout/stderr of detached, re-exec'd Wine children
    across the wineserver boundary — same class of problem as the original.
- **SWG install is incomplete** (237 MB: launcher + bundled JRE + 2 patch
  `.tre` fragments; no base game data). Launcher runs; game never downloaded.
- **#84 is currently worked around.** With `dwrite=builtin` + `prism.order=j2d`
  + `-Xint`, **login SUCCEEDS** (verified live — reached the post-login screen,
  "Update Required — 571 patches"). The reachable crash is #93 (the patcher),
  which needs the full multi-hundred-MB download (not driven — long + corrupts
  state, and the capture path can't catch it anyway).
- **Crash read (from `hs_err_pid228.log`, the real on-disk data):**
  `EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION` at **`ntdll.dll+0x52070`** (Wine builtin ntdll),
  near-null deref (`ecx=0x107`), on a daemon thread `_thread_blocked_trans`,
  **during a JVM safepoint** (VM `synchronizing`; VMThread holds
  `Safepoint_lock`+`Threads_lock`). Loaded: glass/dwrite/opengl/**wined3d**
  (no DXVK). **This signature matches neither documented issue** (#84
  `pc=0x7bf2800b` BitSet.equals; #93 `pc=0xfffffcc8` vtable) — it's a third
  signature: a Wine-ntdll fault during JVM thread-suspension for a safepoint.
- **Leading fix direction for #84/#93:** Wine-fork ntdll thread-suspension /
  SEH gap (NtSuspendThread / NtSetContextThread / exception dispatch) —
  CrossOver-patches-vs-Gcenx-11.9. **Not** app-level, **not** DXVK/Vulkan,
  **not** Crosswire config (env/plist/dwrite all correct; login works).
  Engine-level effort; out of scope per the brief.

## In-game attempt + remaining blockers (2026-05-29)

Drove the full path: download → install → launch the game client.

- **Download completed: 8.4 GB, 202 `.tre`, `SwgClient_r.exe` present.** The
  crash fix held the whole way — **0 new `hs_err` dumps** across a 12 hr
  download and the client launch.
- **Stall pattern (feeds the winsock self-recovery task):** one genuine
  mid-download stall at **4382 MB (file 361/571)** — connections dropped to
  `CLOSE_WAIT`/`CLOSED`, size flatlined, the patcher hung (its blocking read
  never returned because Wine's winsock doesn't signal the dropped FIN). **One
  restart** (kill → relaunch → re-login → Update) resumed it; it then ran to
  completion. (A second apparent "stall" at 8577 MB was just the patcher idle
  at *done* — re-login showed "Ready to play".) So: **1 stall, 1 restart**.
- **Crosswire awareness: good** — bottle `primaryProgramURL` = the launcher
  (correct: Launch runs the launcher → Play runs the client); `drive_c` now
  contains `SwgClient_r.exe` so `updateInstalledPrograms` sees it; library row
  shows "Star Wars Galaxies Legends".
- **⛔ NEW BLOCKER — game client renders a BLACK SCREEN.** Clicking Play
  launches `SwgClient_r.exe` and it **runs without crashing** (so the crash fix
  carries into the client), CPU ~5%, but the window stays pure black (no
  loading/login/world; focus+Enter+Space did nothing). Root cause: the client
  renders D3D9 via **wined3d → `opengl32` → `AppleMetalOpenGLRenderer`**
  (macOS's deprecated GL-over-Metal) — a known black-screen path. **DXVK is off
  AND not installed** (`dxvkConfig.dxvk = false`; `Libraries/DXVK` is empty —
  only Wine's own `d3d9.dll` exists; `enableDXVK` would fail on a missing DXVK
  folder). MoltenVK/Vulkan itself initializes fine in-process, so the fix is to
  **bundle/install a MoltenVK-compatible DXVK and enable it** (D3D9 → Vulkan →
  MoltenVK → Metal). This is a real engine/setup task, not a toggle — its own
  focused effort.

## Next-session queue (priority order)
(Done this session: capture-path fix `72f07be`; SWG #84/#93 crash fix `3fad7e6`;
SWG fully downloaded + game client launches with no crash.)
1. **DXVK for the game client (the in-game blocker)** — install a
   MoltenVK-compatible DXVK into `Libraries/DXVK/{x64,x32}`, enable
   `dxvkConfig.dxvk`, relaunch `SwgClient_r.exe`, confirm it renders past the
   black screen to the in-game login/world. Until this lands, **do NOT close
   #84/#93** — login + patching work, but in-game render is unconfirmed.
2. **Winsock CLOSE_WAIT self-recovery** (engine task) — a dropped connection
   leaves the JVM's socket read blocked forever (Wine doesn't deliver the FIN),
   so the patcher hangs instead of retrying. Fix so dropped connections resume
   without a manual launcher restart (candidates: a Wine winsock/registry
   timeout, JVM `sun.net` socket-read timeouts, or a patcher watchdog).
3. **Minimize the safepoint flag set** — `3fad7e6` ships the full working combo;
   confirm which are load-bearing (likely `-XX:-UseBiasedLocking`).
4. **Single-instance pass** — argv-matching, basename collisions, `.regular`
   focus.
5. **Light mode**; minor `DiagnosticsView` "Engine" wording; (optional)
   diagnostics live-stdout capture of detached children.

## Design direction (note, NOT a task)
Future: a **health-check / remediation system** that auto-recovers from known
failure modes (e.g. detect a download stall → auto-restart the launcher and
resume). Build it **per-rule, only after each failure is fully diagnosed** — a
remediation that fires on a misunderstood signal is worse than none. First
candidate: download-stall auto-restart, pending the winsock CLOSE_WAIT
diagnosis (#2 above).

## Out of scope (designed-for, not built)
Notifications panel (bell placeholder), What's New panel (sparkle
placeholder), background-install rework, icon extraction, Sentry.

## Open issues
- **#84 / #93 — crash fixed, NOT yet closed.** The JVM safepoint flags
  (`3fad7e6`) fixed the launcher crashes: SWG logs in, loads content, and
  downloaded the full game (8.4 GB) with **zero crashes**. **Keep open** until
  in-game render is confirmed — the game client currently launches but renders
  a black screen (DXVK blocker, queue #1). Don't close until you can actually
  play. (#90 and #92 closed earlier.)

## Repo state
- Branch `main`. This session shipped: inline-panel **consistency pass**
  (`b1cc1dd`, `b184252`, `4717593`); diagnostics **capture-path fix**
  (`72f07be`); **SWG #84/#93 crash fix** (`3fad7e6`); docs.
- The SWG bottle's per-program plist `_JAVA_OPTIONS` was updated in place (data,
  not committed) with the safepoint flags. `dxvkConfig.dxvk` left **false**
  (DXVK isn't installed; enabling it without the DLLs would fail a launch).
- SWG is **fully downloaded** (8.4 GB). All SWG processes were cleaned up at
  end of session.
- CI: green through `4717593`; confirm on `3fad7e6` + this doc.
- Working tree clean after the SESSION-STATE commit lands.
