/// The top-level navigation state of the Crosswire main window.

/// Crosswire is single-window — Settings and per-entry detail are NOT
/// separate macOS windows or modal sheets. They're full-bleed inline
/// destinations within the same window, replacing the library view
/// underneath. Matches Battle.net's pattern (slide-in from the right,
/// title-bar + nav stays put, Done returns to the library).
///
/// Adding a new destination: add a case here, add a matching overlay
/// branch in `ContentView.body`, route to it from a button. The
/// `withAnimation { route = .x }` pattern + the `.transition(.move(...))`
/// modifier on each overlay handles the slide animation.
enum AppRoute: Equatable, Hashable {
    /// The default library view. The user lands here on launch.

    /// so the route is `Equatable`/`Hashable` (a `Bottle` reference would
    /// break both). The view resolves the bottle from `BottleVM.bottles`
    /// at render time; if it's been removed (uninstalled while showing),
    /// the navigation falls back to `.library`.
