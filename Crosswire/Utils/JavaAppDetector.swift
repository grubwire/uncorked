/// File-system heuristic for detecting that an .exe ships its own JRE

/// sliver-renders under Wine until `_JAVA_OPTIONS` flips Prism to the
/// j2d (software) pipeline and the JVM into interpreted mode.
///
/// Pure functions, no side effects beyond reading the file system. Kept
/// separate from `RuntimeDetector` (which inspects PE imports for Win32
/// dynamic dependencies like VC++/dotnet/d3dx): the two are orthogonal —
