/// Single source of truth for every color, gradient, surface, accent, and
/// typography token used in Crosswire's UI. Every hex value here was either
/// sampled directly from `AppIcon.icon/Assets/crosswire_512_2x_1024px__layered.png`
/// or chosen to complement those samples per the Brief 2 spec.
///
/// Rules of engagement:
/// 1. NEVER hardcode a hex value in a view. Reference these tokens.
/// 2. Surface tones step UP from the background gradient in deliberate
///    increments (8% / 12% / blue-tint 10%). Stay on the scale.
/// 3. The four tile colors (blue/green/yellow/red) come from the icon's
///    four-tile motif. Use them ONLY for monogram fallback tiles and the
///    occasional categorical accent — they're loud; don't paint with them.
/// 4. Accent (the icon's signature blue tile color) is the ONE interactive
///    color: primary buttons, focus rings, selected state. Resist diluting.
